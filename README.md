This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First , add NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_HOST,
which is the service host in the development case it would be 3000 

Then, install required packages:

```bash
npm i

```
then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```
This would run on 3001 if you have development service running on 3000

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
